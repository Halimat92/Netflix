Project: Analyzing Movie Duration Trends on Netflix

Overview:
This project explores the evolving landscape of movie lengths on Netflix. Originally launched as a DVD rental service in 1997, Netflix has grown into one of the world’s largest entertainment platforms. With thousands of titles available, it offers a rich dataset for examining trends in content production and consumption.

Objective:
To investigate whether the average duration of movies on Netflix has been declining over time, and identify the factors influencing this trend.

Approach:
1	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix’s movie catalog using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2	Filtered and cleaned data to focus exclusively on movies (excluding series and specials)
3	Analyzed yearly trends in average movie duration, visualizing shifts across decades
4	Explored potential drivers of shorter runtimes, such as genre preferences, audience engagement trends, and production strategies
5	Built clear data visualizations to communicate findings

Key Insights:
1	Found a noticeable decline in average movie duration over recent years
2	Shorter runtimes were more common in comedy and teen-focused genres, possibly linked to mobile-first viewing habits
3	The trend may reflect changing viewer behavior, such as shorter attention spans and the rise of on-demand streaming formats

Tools & Tech:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
