Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.  Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

Utilizing initial research findings, conduct an in-depth analysis of Netflix data to discern any patterns or trends in movie lengths. Furthermore, identify potential contributing factors to any observed changes in movie durations, providing insights into the dynamics shaping movie production and consumption on the platform.
